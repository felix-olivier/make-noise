To install requirements run

```$ pip install pysine```

To start bass line run

```$ python3 make_noise/bass.py```

It sounds better with multiple bass lines so open another terminal and run

```$python3 make_noise/bass.py```

and repeat that a bunch of times.

In a new terminal run the following to add vocals, drums or lead.

```$ python3 make_noise/vocals.py```

```$ python3 make_noise/drum.py```

```$ python3 make_noise/noise.py```

For now it only works when the `$ say` command is available.
